"""Multi-channel foundation.

Defines the channel-agnostic contract that concrete channel adapters (web,
LINE, Facebook, ...) will implement in future sprints. This is *structure
only* — no channel is implemented here.

The intent is that inbound platform payloads are normalized into
`InboundMessage`, and application responses are expressed as `OutboundMessage`
regardless of the originating channel, so the conversation/AI layers stay
channel-independent.
